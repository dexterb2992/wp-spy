    <div class="main_text1">Dear Graphics-Challenged Marketer,<br /><br />I won’t shock you by saying that <b>videos</b> are all the rage right now. <br /><br />They are an incredibly powerful way to capture the attention of your target audience.<br /><br />If you think about it for a second, <a href="#">smart marketers</a> have invested a considerable amount of time and money in platforms like Youtube, Vimeo or Google Hangouts over the past few years<br /><br />...only not to be left out in the latest marketing craze...<br /><br />And up until recently, having quality videos used to be a privilege..<br /><br />But no more!<br /><br />...a new wave of maverick entrepreneurs like YOU are changing the rules of the game...<br /><br />by taking control of their own marketing.<br /><br />The issue is not everyone is taking advantage of this new wave...<br /><br />
		<ul>
        	<li>Are you struggling with becoming an AUTHORITY in your niche?</li>
            <li>Are you sick and tired of writing articles only to get a hanful of backlinks and virtually no recognition ?</li>
            <li>Do you wish there was an easier way to look like a professional with minimal effort?</li>
        </ul>
        Let’s face it, whatever you do online <b>content is still the king</b>...<br /><br />Without quality content your site will remain a no-man's land.</strong><br /><br />That’s right.<br /><br />Gone are the times where you could just 'slap' a $5 article on GoArticles and expect floods of traffic coming to your website.<br /><br />We’re in 2013 now. Yes the times, «they are a-changin»...<br /><br />Now everyone owns a Wordpress blog, a Tumblr AND a fanpage and the only way to stand out is by screaming out your uniqueness.<br /><br />And from what I have seen so far, it’s crystal clear that most people have been doing it wrong...<br /><br />The truth is..</div>
    <div class="impression_matter"><strong>Video Marketing Is An<br />Unprecedented <u>Rise</u></strong><br /><br /><img src="images/proof.gif" alt="" /></div>
    <div class="look_at_this_way">Look at it this way:<br /><br />
    <span>1</span> <strong>Video marketing allows you to instantly brand yourself as an expert and thought-leader</strong>  of whatever niche(s) you may be in<br /><br clear="all" />
    <span>2</span> <strong>100% of studies conducted proved that video marketing increase sales </strong> and user engagement, allowing you to drive more traffic and therefore more sales<br /><br clear="all" />
    <span>3</span> <strong>Videos get 267% more backlinks than normal posts</strong> - and 20% of people will read text while 80% will watch a video with the same exact content<br /><br /><br />Needless to say, video marketing = increased brand authority, popularity and sales...<br /><br />...you know that, and I know that.</div>
    <div class="only_problem_is">The only problem is...<br /><br /><strong>Branding Yourself<br />On Video Is Extremely Difficult.</strong><br /><br /><img src="images/dark.png" alt="" /></div>
    <div class="look_at_this_way"><center><small>Your average Joe Marketer Google Hangout... Would you buy anything from this guy?</small></center><br />Truth be told, branding your videos the proper way does take professional skills.<br /><br />First you need to figure out what the best image ratio is for videos (and trust me this is already no mean feat).<br /><br />Secondly you need to think about which are the best fonts for lower third graphics and then find (hopefully not steal) vector images,  patterns, call-outs and other graphics to make your videos stand out.<br /><br />Finally you need to come up with gorgeous designs that can draw visitors to trust your brand and actually buy stuff from you.<br /><br />But don't even think about using Paint to do these... <br /><br />You can try with Gimp if you are one of the braves.. <br /><br />but to be honest I wouldn't even recommend these sub-par solutions to my worst enemy.<br /><br />Truth is...</div>
    <div class="tagline1">You Don't Have The <strong>Money</strong> To Buy Photoshop,<br />You Don't Have The <strong>Skills</strong> To Use It Yet And You<br />Don't Have The <strong>Time</strong> To Master The Skills.</div>
    <div class="look_at_this_way">So what do you do?<br /><br />You might try to hire a "lower third graphic designer" on Fiverr...<br /><br />... but I can safely bet you'll be handed yet an other sub-par template, your videos will look dirt-cheap and you will likely lose customers over it.<br /><br />Or you might even try to buy some lower third templates from marketplaces like VideoHive... <br /><br />But who wants to shell out $600 just to be able to customize these templates?</div>
